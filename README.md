## Inspiration:
The inspiration behind OpenLearning was to create a platform that democratizes education by providing free access to quality resources to anyone, anywhere, at any time. It is inspired by resolving the 4th Goal of Sustainable Development Goals listed out by the UN (Quality Education).

## What it does:
OpenLearning provides a comprehensive library of online resources, courses, and tutorials covering a vast range of subjects, from computer programming and data science to creative writing and business management. It allows students to learn at their own pace, interact with educators and peers, and track their progress.

## How we built it:
OpenLearning was built using a combination of modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Jeklly theme. We gathered the best resources from among the best educators, subject matter experts, and industry professionals to curate and develop high-quality educational content.

## Challenges we ran into:
One of the main challenges we faced was sourcing reliable and accurate information from the internet, given the vast amount of misinformation and low-quality resources available online. We also had to ensure that the platform was accessible and user-friendly for learners with diverse backgrounds and skill levels.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We are proud to have developed a platform that has helped millions of learners worldwide to gain new skills, advance their careers, and achieve their personal and professional goals. We have also gathered the best quality resources to provide free education to underserved communities.

## What we learned:
Through OpenLearning, we have learned the power of collaboration, community, and technology in democratizing education and breaking down barriers to access. We have also learned the importance of constantly evolving and adapting to meet the changing needs of learners and educators.

## What's next for OpenLearning:
Our goal for the future is to continue expanding and improving our platform, increasing the diversity and quality of our resources, and exploring new ways to leverage emerging technologies to enhance the learning experience. We also aim to build stronger partnerships and collaborations with educators and organizations to drive innovation and impact in education.
